New evidence supporting the existence of the hypothetic X17 particle
 arxiv.org/abs/1910.10459
H DNew evidence supporting the existence of the hypothetic X17 particle Abstract: We observed electron-positron pairs from the electro-magnetically forbidden M0 transition depopulating the 21.01 MeV 0$^-$ state in $^4$He. A peak was observed in their $e^ e^-$ angular correlations at 115$^\circ$ with 7.2$\sigma$ significance, and could be described by assuming the creation and subsequent decay of a light particle with mass of $m \mathrm X c^2$=16.84$\pm0.16 stat \pm 0.20 syst $ MeV and $\Gamma \mathrm X $= $3.9\times 10^ -5 $ eV. According to the mass, it is likely the same X17 particle, which we recently suggested Phys. Rev. Lett. 116, 052501 2016 for describing the anomaly observed in $^8$Be.
